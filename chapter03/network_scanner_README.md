### Explanation:
1. Log Parsing:
Uses regular expressions to extract fields such as IP, timestamp, request method, status code, and size.

2. Data Analysis:
Converts log data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Provides basic statistics like total requests, unique IPs, and large requests.

3. Visualization:
Creates bar charts for status code distribution and top IPs by request count.

4. Results Saving:
Saves the analyzed data into a CSV file for record-keeping.

### Usage:
* Place your log file in the same directory as the script and ensure itâ€™s named access.log or adjust the file_path variable.
* Install required libraries (pandas, matplotlib) using:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
  Run the script to analyze and visualize the log data.
